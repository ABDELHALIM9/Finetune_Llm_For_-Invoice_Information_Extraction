# Finetune\_LLM\_For\_Invoice\_Information\_Extraction

This project fine-tunes the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct vision-language model on the CORD-V2 dataset for the purpose of extracting structured data from invoice documents, such as dates, totals, vendors, and more. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), it aims to improve the understanding and extraction of information from complex, scanned invoices.

This repository includes the fine-tuned model and training scripts to help you replicate the process and perform custom invoice extraction tasks.

**Model Details:**

* **Model:** Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct
* **Dataset:** CORD-V2 (for invoice document extraction)
