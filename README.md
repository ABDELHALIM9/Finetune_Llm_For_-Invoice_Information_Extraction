# Finetune_Llm_For_-Invoice_Information_Extraction
Invoice Information Extraction with Qwen2-VL and CORD-V2 This project fine-tunes the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct vision-language model on the CORD-V2 dataset to extract structured data (e.g., dates, totals, vendors) from invoice documents. It leverages LLMs for accurate understanding of complex scanned receipts.
